\subsection{Recommendation of Approach to Solving the Problem}
\paragraph{}
As this is an extremely complex program, despite there only being 1 person on the development team, I am going to use the structured approach to create this program. 

\paragraph{}
Firstly, I will design the interaction between each part of the system (a "part" might be, for example, converting an image to a depth map, or deciding where you are based on the depth map and your current map). I will design and code up each part one at a time, however, because each part is very large, and will include many functions and classes. That way, if the project becomes too hard to complete, I can hand in 1 or 2 parts, and still have it working.

\paragraph{}
Within each part, I will have an extremely large set of functions. For this reason, before I start coding, I will first plan out how to test it, and draw up a system flowchart or write stubs for the part, describing the inputs and outputs of each function. Next, I will create test data. For example, to test the login, I would write several tests which tested whether the password was checked correctly, whether invalid usernames such as being blank were allowed, etc.

\paragraph{}
Before I start coding any function, I will ensure I know the expected inputs and outputs. If it is a complex function, I may come up with a proof of correctness and some pseudocode for it in order to eliminate bugs before I start coding.
